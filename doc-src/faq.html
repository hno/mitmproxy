    <p class="question">On some sites I see a lot of "Connection from.."
    entries that never complete.</p>

    <p> This is probably because the page requests resources from SSL-protected
    domains. These requests are intercepted by mitmproxy, but because we're
    using a bogus certificate, the browser-side of the connection hangs. The
    browser doesn't prompt you to add a certificate trust exception for remote
    page components, only for the primary domain being visited. </p>
    
    <p> To solve this, use something like FireBug to find out which page
    components are hanging. Visit the relevant domains using your browser, and
    add a certificate trust exception for each one. </p>


    <p class="question">I'm pentesting an non-browser app that checks SSL
    certificate validity. How do I make it trust the MITMProxy certificate?</p>


    <p> Here's a quick and easy procedure you can use for Windows 7, as long as
    the app in question uses the global Windows certificate repository. </p>

    <ul>

        <li> First copy the file <b>libmproxy/resources/bogus_template</b>
        from the MITMProxy source, and edit it to include your target domain in
        the CN parameter. The result should look like this:

<pre>[ req ]
prompt = no
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C               = NZ
ST              = none
L               = none
O               = none
OU              = none
CN              = target.domain.com
emailAddress    = none</pre>
        </li>

        <li> Next, use your bogus template to generate a certificate, and
        install it for MITMPRoxy to use:

<pre>openssl req -config ./my_bogus_template -x509 -nodes -days 9999 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert -out mycert

cp mycert ~/.mitmproxy/cert.pem</pre>
        </li>

        <li> Fire up MITMProxy, and configure Firefox on the Windows box to use
        it. Browse to the target domain, and you should see a big warning about
        an untrusted certificate. Use Firefox to export the certificate ("Add
        Exception", "Get Certificate", then "View", tab to "Details" and click
        "Export").  </li>

        <li> From the command console, fire up <b>certmgr</b>. Select "Trusted
        Root Certification Authorities", then on the top menu, "Action", "All
        Tasks", and "Import". When prompted, select the certificate file you've
        just saved from Firefox.</li>

        <li> And that's it - your certificate should now be trusted for that
        domain. Happy pentesting.</li>

    </ul>
